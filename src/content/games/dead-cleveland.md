Maybe some of us will last long enough that, one day, the zombies will just suddenlyâ€¦stop the same way they suddenly started.

Or maybe all we can ask for is to be the last to be eaten.

In Dead Cleveland, you play as one of the few humans who has managed to survive the month following a zombie apocalypse. You left your old home and banded together with your fellow survivors to create a new home in downtown Cleveland, Ohio. Each survivor plays a role in keeping your settlement functional, and your role, either by yourself or with a team, is to venture into the city in search of essential supplies and friendly survivors.
