Born of my never-ending love for the Sly Cooper franchise, Honor Among Thieves is a tribute micro TTRPG (for 3+ players) about the thievish activities of a group of honorable master thieves who seek to only steal from other criminals. Will you remain honorable and loyal to your gang or will you end up becoming just like the petty criminals you've been trying so hard to bring down? Play to find out!

Touchstones: Leverage (TV show), Now You See Me (media franchise), Sly Cooper franchise (video games), and To Steal From a Thief (movie)
