> When Uncle John died, everyone was surprised by his will.

> He was a strange old man. He rarely left his home and never had any visitors. The last time anyone from the family saw him was that Christmas that cousin Brian dropped that big jar of pickles. That was six years ago.

> But he left his house, and everything in it to you.

> Your parents told you to stay away from the old place. They said it was a death trap. It needs to be renovated before they can sell it. Possibly fumigated if you believe the neighbors.

> But youâ€™ve got a key. And friends hungry for adventure.

> The lock turns and you can hear ticking in the walls as you stand on the threshold. A black cat rubs against your leg, sauntering into the house, almost asking you to follow.

> Will you?

In The House of Many Things, you play kids embarking on a wild, magical, multidimensional adventure. One of you has inherited an old, strange house filled with magical doorways. Will you simply explore, helping the Residents solve their problems, learning about the worlds and the people in them? Or will you discover the deeper mysteries of the House, uncover the keys to locked rooms, and defeat the darkness dwelling deep within?
