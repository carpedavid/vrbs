You are a special agent who works for the secretive counter-terrorism organization known as the Feline Operations Group. Together with your fellow agents, you travel the world stopping dastardly villains from carrying out their diabolical plans.

Travel to exotic locales, investigate mysteries, fight henchmen, and save the world in this GM-less, no-prep game of heroic derring-do for one or more players. The ultra-light VRBS system emphasizes the fun of improvisational storytelling and learning by doing, and is appropriate for players aged six and up.
