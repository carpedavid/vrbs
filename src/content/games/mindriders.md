You are a Mindrider - a special operative sent by advanced technology to make sure pivotal moments go the way they're supposed to, by borrowing the body of the right person at the right time. The consciousness of the body you're borrowing isn't harmed, they're just asleep, but you have to complete your mission before they throw you off and take back control.

A lightweight narrative game using the VRBS system, where your character is defined by what they do, and you grow through failure. 

Solo-friendly, cooperative, gmless, and randomly generated, with 1 page of rules and 1 page of tables.
