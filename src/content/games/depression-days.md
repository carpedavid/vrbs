Depression Days takes place during the Great Depression, an economic crisis in the 1920s that ended the Gilded Age and led to a slump for the next two decades until the post-WWII era.

Your characters are part of the criminal underworldâ€”moonshiners, bootleggers, and their associates in political and social life.
