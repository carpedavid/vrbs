Princess Guard is a role-playing game of magical adventure starring magical princesses and their spirit companions.

In Princess Guard, you play a magical princess from one of the royal realms of the Floating Islands of Orthavia. You’ll team up with your fellow princesses to explore new lands, defend your realm, help your people, tend to the spirits, visit other realms, and rescue travelers in distress.

On these missions, you’ll fight ferocious foes, discover amazing treasures, and meet wonderful people. You’ll grow by trying new things and learning from your mistakes. Your friends will always be there to help, so the only way to fail as part of the Princess Guard is not to try.

In this game book, you’ll find a short introduction to the Floating Islands, a quick and easy guide to creating your princess, and 18 detailed missions for your princess to undertake. It is written to be accessible to early readers and also provides tips for grown-ups to help facilitate play.
