You are a monster! Just like your monstrous friends at Spooky Town Elementary, you have a monstrous family, creepy pets, and live in a cobweb-covered, haunted house. Today is the spookiest day of the year — Halloween. It’s the job of you and your friends to make sure that your town has the scariest night ever!

Utilizing the ultralight VRBS system, Spooky Town is easy enough for a six year-old to master, but also provides the structure for anyone to generate a light-hearted spooky story of their own.
