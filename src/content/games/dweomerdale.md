In the beautiful valley of Dweomerdale, magic is a way of life â€” pixies use it to play pranks and goblins use it to cause mischief. You, though, are a student in the Dweomerdale Junior Academy, where you are learning to be a sorcerer. Together with your friends and classmates, you hone your skills while undertaking fantastic adventures.

Utilizing the ultralight VRBS system, Dweomerdale is easy enough for a six year-old to master, but also provides the structure for anyone to generate a fantastic story of magical adventure on their own.
