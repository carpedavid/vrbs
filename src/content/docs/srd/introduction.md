title: Introduction

VRBS is an ultralight system for creating highly improvisational role-playing games that reward creative, heroic action. It has a **universal conflict resolution** mechanic that requires a single six-sided die and is easy enough for a six-year old to master.

In VRBS, characters are defined by **what they do**, not by abstract statistics. Characters can attempt anything that a creative hero would be able to reasonably accomplish and they either succeed or grow in the process.

VRBS supports **zero-prep, GM-less play** for **solo and team games**. Scenarios are generated at play time and the players collaboratively interpret prompts to drive the story forward.

VRBS is best suited to a **short, episodic style** of play that encourages creativity in both young and old.
